# Omnisient Technical Assesment Submission

This repo contains the code for my solution to the Omnisient tech test. It contains two core parts: 

## Backend (C#)
The backend is written in C# and serves as an API. It recieves purchase transaction data from the user and uses dynamic programming to find the optimal solution (i.e. the lowest combination of coins required for a given ammount of change).

## Front end (Angular)
The front end is written in Angular and provides an easy to use interface to interact with the backend API. Users can enter purchase and tender ammounts along with a currency (optional), which is then sent to the API. The result is returned in a plain text format, along with a visual representation.

## Running the program 
Simply import the solution into Visual Studio. It will automatically install the required dependencies, afterwhich you can run the program (this will launch the front end and backend).
